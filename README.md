Team Obsidian

The purpose of our application is to select the likely Democratic and Republican Party nominees, as well as the general election winner for the 2016 US Presidential Election from available data. In order to do this, we collected data about the upcoming presidential election and organized it into a database. We took into account primary and general election data (current and historical), political data about individual states, and data pulled from Twitter. We made our decision using these data alone and let no outside opinions influence us.
